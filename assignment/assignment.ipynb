        "1. This paper discusses the idea of how data cleaning process can be optimized to be easier and effective through data tidying. This idea of tidying makes it easier to manipulate and visualize datasets by having a structure of variables being columns, observations as rows, and observational units as tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. It intends to establish a framework with how to tidy messy datasets of all types without having to utilize too many tools and creating a new process to clean new data every time. This allows for users to focus more on the exploration and analysis of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. In the first sentence, the phrase \"Like families, tidy datasets are alike\" means that tidy datasets tend to follow the same principles such as the structure mentioned in the abstract. The rest of that sentence explains that though they follow that structure, each dataset may have its own problems such as duplicate values, missing values or other errors. The second sentence describes how based on a given dataset, using the structure given in the abstract, it's easy to understand what each piece of data represents. However, it is very difficult to provide a universal definition of variables and observations as an observation in one dataset can be considered a variable in another as studies can be taken in different contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. A value is either a number or a string that belongs to a variable and oand bservation. A variable is a collection of values that measure the same attribute across units. An observation is a collection of values measured across the same unit over multiple attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Tidy data is based on 3 characteristics: Each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. The 5 most common problems with messy datasets are: Column headers are values and not variable names, multiple variables are stored in one column, variables are stored in both rows and columns, multiple types of obersvational units are stored in the same table, and a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. The data in table 4 is considered messy because it variables form both rows and columns, and the columns are values that measure income instead of being variable names such as \"Agnostic\". \"Melting\" a dataset means turning columns into rows.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Table 11 is considered messy because it utilizes each day of the month as columns when those are considered values and the column element has 2 possible values which are being repeated for every possible month. Instead, table 12 just congregates those values into 1 column called date and it created 2 other columns called tmax and tmin which eliminates duplicates. Overall, table 12 is 'molten' as each column focuses on attributes and not values.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. The chicken-and-egg problem Wickham describes is that tidy data is only as useful as the tools working with it and these tools only get better as tidy data gets better. Wickham hopes that others will help build on this idea of tidy data to help improve data storage strategies and tools that will progress data science as a whole."
